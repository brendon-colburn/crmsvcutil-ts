#Introduction
Similar to how CrmSvcUtil helps make development better server-side the goal of CrmSvcUtilTypeScript is to make client-side development better for CRM.

#Getting Started
1.	Clone the repository to your environment
2.	Open in Visual Studio
3.	Install Typewriter extension
4.	Run the application in your environment
5.  If the typescript file didn't generate right click on template1.tst and choose render template 

#Contribute
Reach out to me if you'd like to contribute.  Some improvement ideas include:
1. Get the application Typewriter agnostic so it can work as a standalone release exe as opposed to running from source code.
2. Improve the generated WebAPI service:
    * linq queries in javascript
    * upgrade from angular1 to angular2
3. Get this app into the Crm SDK distribution
4. Get this app into XrmToolbox
